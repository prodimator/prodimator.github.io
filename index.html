      <p>So I once did this thing that did some stuff and it looked pretty cool and usability was awesome and lots of people liked it and so did I so I made another thing like it and the end. But then I had this other idea and I did that too and it was cool and more people liked it but some didn't so I made some changes that made those people like it more but then some others who did before now didn't so moral of the story is that you can't please everyone.</p>
